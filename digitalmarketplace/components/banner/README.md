# Banner Component

The banner component is a container used to highlight important information which are the result of a state change, but not the user's action. The macro requires a `title` string as its parameter with a message to the user describing the state change. For additional information either the `text` or the `html` parameters can be used, which will render with a smaller font than the title. The `html` parameter is rendered with the safe filter to allow flexibility to developers and designers, but also needs to be used only with sanitised inputs to avoid XSS attacks. The heading level of the title can be changed from 1-6 (default is 2) via the `headingLevel` parameter, but this won't affect the font's style. Finally, extra `classes` and `attributes` can be added to the containing div of the component by the two parameters of that name.
