# Attachment

An attachment is used to link to a document which can be downloaded. It is heavily based on the [GOV.UK Publishing Components Attachment](https://components.publishing.service.gov.uk/component-guide/attachment)

See attachment.yaml for the parameters that can be passed to the component.
