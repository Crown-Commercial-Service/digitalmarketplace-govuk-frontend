# Option select

An option select is used for filter forms. It consists of a govukCheckboxes component which is wrapped by a collapsing/expanding element.

It is based heavily on the Finder app's option select: https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend/blob/master/app/views/components/_option-select.html.erb
